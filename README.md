# Simple Ecommerce Website using Django

This is a simple e-commerce website built using the Django web framework. It is designed to provide a basic structure for an online store and can be used as a starting point for building a more complex e-commerce platform. This README file will guide you through setting up and running the project.

## Features

- User registration and authentication
- Product listing with details
- Shopping cart functionality
- Checkout and order management
- Product search and filtering
- Admin panel for managing products, categories, and orders

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Python 3.x installed on your machine.
- `pip` package manager installed.
- Virtual environment (optional but recommended).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ecommerce-django.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd ecommerce-django
   ```

3. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

4. Install project dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. Run the database migrations to create the necessary database tables:

   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

6. Create a superuser for admin access:

   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

7. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

The application should now be running locally. You can access the admin panel at `http://localhost:8000/admin/` and use the superuser credentials you created earlier.

## Usage

- Visit the website by navigating to `http://localhost:8000/` in your web browser.
- Register a new user account or log in.
- Browse the product listings, add items to your shopping cart, and proceed to checkout.
- Use the admin panel to manage products, categories, and orders.

## Configuration

You can configure various settings in the `settings.py` file to tailor the application to your needs, including database settings, email configuration, and more.
